<h2>What is roleplaying? What is play-by-post roleplay?</h2><br/>

Roleplaying is playing a role. Play-by-Post roleplay is a form of round-robin writing. Strictly and simply speaking, threads are housed in their relevant location (Terrenus roleplay in Terrenus, Alterion roleplay in Alterion, etc) and members post to those threads. Writing is the medium of our game, which distinguishes PBP roleplay from table-top games (D&D, Warhammer, etc), video games (WoW, GuildWars, etc) and LARP.
<br/><br/>
Our game pieces are our characters and the setting is the world of Valucre itself. Players create threads with their characters and other players reply to those threads with their own characters (or as the setting, or as NPCs, and so on). Collaboration is key and is also a distinguishing feature of roleplay. If you want to control all aspects of a story, all characters, all plot movements, short stories or a novel is probably what you want to write.
<br/><br/>
Valucre is where you come to write with others and contribute to a flowing tapestry of story that is in constant flux, continually added to by the community.
