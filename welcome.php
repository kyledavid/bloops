<h2>What is roleplaying? What is play-by-post roleplay?</h2><br/>

Roleplaying is playing a role. Play-by-Post roleplay is a form of round-robin writing. Strictly and simply speaking, threads are housed in their relevant location (Terrenus roleplay in Terrenus, Alterion roleplay in Alterion, etc) and members post to those threads. Writing is the medium of our game, which distinguishes PBP roleplay from table-top games (D&D, Warhammer, etc), video games (WoW, GuildWars, etc) and LARP.
<br/><br/>
Our game pieces are our characters and the setting is the world of Valucre itself. Players create threads with their characters and other players reply to those threads with their own characters (or as the setting, or as NPCs, and so on). Collaboration is key and is also a distinguishing feature of roleplay. If you want to control all aspects of a story, all characters, all plot movements, short stories or a novel is probably what you want to write.
<br/><br/>
Valucre is where you come to write with others and contribute to a flowing tapestry of story that is in constant flux, continually added to by the community.

Create a character
<br/><br/>
You can have the character in your head or you can make a sheet. Sheets are optional.
<br/><br/>
Though optional, some members find sheets useful for tracking information, especially if they make multiple characters. If you do on a sheet, post in the profile database. Characters must adhere to Mild Powers, which is determined by post content and not character sheets.
<br/><br/>
We have blank character templates for those that want to use them, as well as a completely optional Character Creation Guide for more detailed advice.
<br/><br/>
<h2>When thinking about a character, here are some things to consider, whether in your head or on a sheet:
</h2><br/>
Appearance: What they look like. Basics, things other characters would notice at a glance such as hair and eye color or visible scars, will give your partners relevant details without being repetitious.
Skills/Abilities: Critical information for tournaments and combat roleplays, but usually unnecessary. A short list of skills/abilities will help you keep your character within reasonable limits of knowledge and power.
Occupation: Their job. Usually ties in with the above.
History: Just enough to give your character substance, so it isn't as if they came out of nothing. Anything longer written pieces would be better placed in Creativity Showcase, where our members often display their poetry and prose.
Choose a role play, know the setting

Valucre's lore is immense. Many are tempted to read as much as they can, which is great. That's why it was written. But keep in mind that Valucre's lore is a work which has been added to over a period of years by hundreds of members. Don't feel you have to take that all in before starting a thread.
<br/><br/>
The lore is there to enhance your writing, not to get in the way of it.
<br/><br/>
Do you want to start or find a role play? Go to either the water cooler, to read and post advertisements for role plays and plots, or the Open Roleplays page to see what newly created Open threads have been added.
<br/><br/>
Once you pick up a thread, learn a little about the setting. If you're in a forest, you don't need to know every detail about the history and culture of the nation the forest is in. You read about the forest to know what it looks like, the kind of vegetation and animals maybe, and then that's it. The rest you can learn as your character learns or while you're waiting for replies.
Easy, isn't it?
