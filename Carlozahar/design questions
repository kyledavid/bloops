What content boxes would you like to include? (Welcome, Roleplay News, User)

For each box, what content will it contain? (text, pics, links)

Visually, do you want the navbar to look exactly like the current Valucre nav? The Mizahar Nav? Something else?

How closely do you want the layout to resemble Mizahar? Anything you want to do differently?

Are there any specific graphics you want me to use for backgrounds and such? Are you in the process of looking? Can I just find my own?

For individual blog pages, do you have a preference for what the layout looks like?

Do you want me to stick with the Valucre Blues for site color? What about using the colors found on the Valucre forum as well?

Any particular text color you want to use?
